Given the following:

class  PuzzleSolver(object):
    WORDS = ['OX', 'CAT', 'TOY', 'AT', 'DOG',  'CATAPULT', 'T']
    
    def is_word(self, word):
	""" 
	Returns true of word is in the dictionary, false otherwise.
	"""
	return word in self.WORDS
	
    def find_words(self, puzzle):
	"""
	Should return the number of all non-distinct  occurrences
	of the words found in puzzle, horizontally, vertically 
	or diagonally,  and also the reverse in each direction. 
	The input to find_words (i.e. puzzle ) is a rectangular 
	matrix of characters (list of strings).
	"""
	pass

Implement the function find_words(self, puzzle)

8

This 8 words are:

Example Input 2:

[
    "CATAPULT",
    "XZTTOYOO",
    "YOTOXTXX"
]

22

Notes:

We are trying to see the quality of the code you write (hint: unit tests, comments, pep8). You will be mainly
evaluated on how well you break down the problem and how well you test your code. Donâ€™t worry too much about
performance and efficiency but your program should work correctly. It should also be capable of scaling to
puzzles with dimensions such as 4x4, 6x9, 9x9.
